biostatistic method
======
* Mastered the basic biostatistics methods.
* Correlation analysis, analysis of variance (ANOVA), regression analysis(SLR, MLR, Logistic regression), etc.
* Parametric test like 2-sample t-test and one-way anova or nonparametric test like sign test, Wilcoxon signed rank test, rank sum test and Fisherâ€™s Exact test.
* [Here](../files/bm_final_report-1.pdf) is a group project we use K-M curve, cox ph model and logistic regression to predict breast cancer patient's survival rate.

data science
======
* Familiarized with basic R programming skills.
* Learned to use R for interaction with other applications, such as Shiny and web scraping.
* [Here](https://kindlezhang.github.io/p8105_final_project/) is a group presentation in class analyzing the corruption index. I use shiny and make a website.
* I studied basic machine learning knowledge.
* I studied many model training methods: Lasso, Ridge, Elastic Net, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Principal Components Regression (PCR), Generalized Additive Model (GAM), Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS)
* [Here](../files/P8106_midterm_report.pdf) is a project exploring the factors associated with recovery time for COVID-19 patients.
* Classfication tree, Probabilistic Models (Linear Discriminant Analysis, Quadratic Discriminant Analysis and Naive Bayes) and Kernal-based model (Support Vector Machines with Linear Kernel and Support Vector Machines with Radial Kernel) are also included.
* [Here](../files/ds_final.pdf) is a project exploring the factors affecting the severity of COVID-19.


advanced computing
======



longitudinal analysis
======
* I learned the transition from linear regression with independent observations to longitudinal data analysis with correlated observations.
* I studied the difference between marginal model (GEE/gls) and the GLMM/GLM model (Max likelihood).
* I studied how to deal with missing data.
* [Here](../files/longi_final_project_qz2527.pdf) is a project exploring wihch model (GLMM or marginal model) is better when analyzing women's contraception.

survival analysis
======
* I learned non-parametric methods in survival analysis, such as the Kaplan-Meier (K-M) curve, semi-parametric methods like the Cox Proportional Hazards (Cox PH) model, and parametric methods, assuming Y follows distributions such as Weibull, Exponential, Log-Logistic, or General Gamma.
* [Here](../files/survival_final_7.pdf) is a project exploring the factors affecting the survival risk for Breast Cancer.
